# Build-time check for the assumption dev.peanuts.ui.LibraryScanner.versionInfo() makes at runtime: that a profile's "recommended" build (shown on the
# Version row and used to relabel Build -> "Build anyway") is the highest version in its game.tsv `build` rows. game.tsv's own `package` line is the real
# answer (the version the shipped shader tables were built for) but is not exposed through BuildConfig.NX_PROFILES, so LibraryScanner approximates it with
# max(build) instead -- see LibraryScanner.java's class doc and GameSheet.java's "Known gaps" note in IMPL-A.md.
#
# CRITIQUE-phase2b.md A-2: the round-2 runtime guard for this (LibraryScanner.checkRecommendedGuard) never actually ran (a stray `break` made it check only
# game.tsv's first line, never the `package` row) and, even fixed, would decompress assets/pack/tools.zip once per title during the first scan on the
# phone for a check that only ever needs to run once, at build time. This script replaces it: no runtime cost, and it catches a mismatch before an APK
# ships instead of after.
#
# For each title given on the command line, or (with none) every profile under dm/games/, compares dm/games/<id>/game.tsv's `package` line against the
# highest version among its `build` rows. Prints one OK/MISMATCH line per title; exits non-zero if any title mismatches, has no `package` line, or has
# no `build` rows.
#
# critique-phase2c A (round 4): the default used to be android/app/gradle.properties' `nxGames`, but that property holds Banana Native's own 5 Switch 2
# defaults, not the titles the Peanuts APK is actually built with (those come from -PnxGames=... at build time, which this script has no way to read
# without invoking Gradle). Checking every dm/games/<id> profile is both simpler and strictly more thorough -- it is what the round-3 run already did
# by hand (131 OK) -- and never misses a title just because it is not (yet, or ever) one of the ones a particular APK build happens to include.
#
# usage: check-profiles.sh [title ID ...]   -- with no arguments, checks every dm/games/<16 hex digit> directory
