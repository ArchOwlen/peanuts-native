# Rebase the `peanuts` overlay onto a Banana Native release (default: latest upstream/android),
# then verify the hooks. This script performs the rebase itself -- it is the one write-ish step
# in the upstream-sync workflow (see peanuts/docs/UPSTREAM.md); the read-only report/diff helpers
# in peanuts/scripts/upstream/ exist so this step has no surprises left in it.
#
# `--check`: run only the hunk-marker check, against the CURRENT branch (no fetch-and-rebase, no
# working-tree-clean requirement), and exit non-zero on failure. This lets the check run now,
# mid-development, or from a pre-commit hook -- CRITIQUE-phase2a.md D-1: previously it only ran
# after a rebase had already rewritten history, which is too late to catch anything before it's
# baked into the overlay branch.

# actual edits. That is exactly --check's situation (no rebase happens), so --check always uses
# the pre-rebase merge-base.

# In rebase mode, the correct "base" is different: AFTER a successful rebase, our branch's own
# history contains $target directly as an ancestor, so the right comparison is diff($target,
# branch) -- not diff(the OLD, pre-rebase merge-base, branch). Using the stale pre-rebase
# merge-base here would make the post-rebase check flag every upstream commit between that old
# merge-base and $target as "a hunk we introduced" too, the identical bug class --check was fixed
# for, just reintroduced on the other side of the rebase. So: compute the pre-rebase merge-base
# only for the check-mode message/comparison; in rebase mode, reset `base="$target"` once the
