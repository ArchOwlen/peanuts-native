# check-publish.sh [<since-ref>] : the gate before anything of Peanuts Native is pushed to a public or shared remote (GitHub). Exit 0 = clean, 1 = fix first.
#
# Rule 1, no AI attribution: no commit in <since-ref>..HEAD may have an AI author or committer, a Co-Authored-By trailer naming an AI tool or its vendor,
#   or a "Generated with" line (Claude, Anthropic, Codex, OpenAI, ChatGPT, GPT, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, Devin, ...). The person who submits a change is its
#   author; tools are not contributors.
# Rule 2, no private data: no file Peanuts changed since <since-ref> may contain a LAN address, a local home or mount path, an assistant's work folder,
#   an adb-over-network address or a personal e-mail. Vendored third-party code (dm/peanuts/third_party) keeps its own copyright lines.
#
# <since-ref> defaults to the merge base with upstream/android (Banana Native's history before it is upstream's, published as the single import commit of the
# public history, see peanuts/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md "Publishing"). peanuts/scripts/install-hooks.sh runs this before every push.
