"""A process pool over pipes for a Python that has no python executable and no _multiprocessing: the on-device packer (android/ONDEVICE.md) runs the tools in
CPython embedded in the app, and the official Android build has no sem_open, so multiprocessing's queues, locks and pools (and concurrent.futures'
ProcessPoolExecutor on them) cannot run there. shader_split.py's scan uses this pool when DM_SPLIT_WORKER=<command> names what runs a worker: a program that
takes `<flags> -c <code> <args>` as python3 does (the phone's nxpack_worker, dm/peanuts/pack_worker, through /system/bin/linker64; python3 itself on a computer).

J workers, each started as `<command> -c BOOT <read fd> <write fd>` and fed one job at a time over a pipe of its own; a thread of this process per worker feeds
it and fulfils its futures. submit / map / with as concurrent.futures' executors. vk_android_build.py's shaders step uses it too (DMSH_VK_WORKER, a script: PipePool argv).
Each worker imports the calling tool as __mp_main__ (and __main__, as multiprocessing's spawn does), so the tool's functions pickle by name as to any pool worker; it runs the initializer, says it is ready, then answers each
(function, args) with (True, result) or (False, exception, traceback text). A worker that does not come up (the command does not run, its Python does not start,
the tool does not import) raises at construction, with the worker's own words in the caller's log: its stdout and stderr are the caller's."""
